**User manual:**

GoSave! is a web application that people can use to compete with their friends see who save the most. We develop a leaderboard that rewards the user who spends their money on the most cost-efficient products. The first tab is where you can search for a specific food you want to eat and the price range you prefer, then the system would recommend the most cost-efficient restaurant near your location based on your needs. We reward the users points based on the performance/price ratio of the restaurants the users select. The second tab is where the users can see their cumulative points, which are updated once per day. In the third part, the users can compare their points with their friends to see who saves the most. We aim to use this ranking-based leadership board to motivate people to save more by reducing their unnecessary expenditure.

The points are calculated based on the performance/price index we designed, which is equal to (rating/price of the restaurant - average rating/price of nearby restaurants_/average rating/price of nearby restaurants
